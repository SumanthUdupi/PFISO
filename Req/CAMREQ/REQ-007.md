# REQ-007: Collision Damping

## 1. Requirement Title
Separate Damping for Collision Steps

## 2. Problem Statement
When the camera hits a wall, it should snap instantly to prevent clipping. When it leaves a wall, it should smooth back out to the desired position. Currently, a single interpolation handles mostly everything (or overrides it hard), leading to jagged movement or latency in collision response.

## 3. Proposed Solution
- **Compression**: Instant (Snap to wall).
- **Decompression**: Smooth (Lerp back to full distance).

## 4. Implementation Details
- **File**: `CameraSystem.tsx`
- **Logic**:
    - Calculate `collisionPos`
    - If `collisionPos` is *closer* than `currentPos`, snap `currentPos = collisionPos` (or very fast lerp).
    - If `collisionPos` is *further*, lerp `currentPos` towards it with standard damping.

## 5. Code Snippets
```typescript
if (targetDist < currentDist) {
    // Snap in (Collision)
    currentDist = targetDist;
} else {
    // Smooth out (Recovery)
    currentDist = THREE.MathUtils.lerp(currentDist, targetDist, dt * 2.0);
}
```

## 6. Expected Benefits
- **Responsiveness**: Immediate reaction to walls.
- **Smoothness**: Gentle recovery when moving away from obstacles.

## 7. Dependencies
- REQ-006

## 8. Priority Level
**High**

## 9. Estimated Complexity
**Moderate**
