# REQ-031: Directional Camera Shake

## 1. Requirement Title
Directional Screen Shake Support

## 2. Problem Statement
Current shake is random noise. Impacts (e.g., getting hit from the left) should push the camera to the right.

## 3. Proposed Solution
Update `CameraShake.tsx` or `CameraSystem` to accept a direction vector in the event payload.

## 4. Implementation Details
- **File**: `CameraShake.tsx`
- **Logic**: Add `direction: Vector3` to state. Add sine wave impulse in that direction that decays.

## 5. Code Snippets
```typescript
eventBus.emit('SCREEN_SHAKE', { intensity: 0.5, direction: new Vector3(1, 0, 0) });
```

## 6. Expected Benefits
- **Feedback**: Helps player locate damage source.

## 7. Dependencies
- REQ-007

## 8. Priority Level
**High**

## 9. Estimated Complexity
**Moderate**
