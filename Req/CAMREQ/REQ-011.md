# REQ-011: Critical Damping for Follow

## 1. Requirement Title
Implement Critical Damping (Spring-Damper)

## 2. Problem Statement
Simple `lerp` (linear interpolation) is frame-rate dependent (if not adjusted correctly) and often feels "floaty" or "laggy". It doesn't allow for "tuning" the stiffness of the camera accurately.

## 3. Proposed Solution
Use a Critical Damping function (or `DampQ` from a library like `maath`) to smooth camera movement. This allows defining "smooth time" or "frequency" which is more intuitive.

## 4. Implementation Details
- **Library**: `maath` (already in use possibly?) or custom function.
- **Function**: `damp(current, target, lambda, dt)` where lambda is stiffness.

## 5. Code Snippets
```typescript
import { damp3 } from 'maath/easing'
// Inside useFrame
damp3(camera.position, targetPos, 0.25, dt)
```

## 6. Expected Benefits
- **Feel**: "Tight" but smooth controls.
- **Consistency**: Mathematically correct smoothing independent of framerate.

## 7. Dependencies
- `maath` (optional, can inline)

## 8. Priority Level
**High**

## 9. Estimated Complexity
**Simple**
