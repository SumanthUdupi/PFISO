# REQ-012: Look Ahead Smoothing

## 1. Requirement Title
Refined Look Ahead Smoothing

## 2. Problem Statement
The current Look Ahead implementation (in `CameraController.tsx`, unused; and `Player.tsx`, simple) can be jittery if the player velocity changes direction rapidly.

## 3. Proposed Solution
Filter the "Look Ahead Target" separately from the Camera Position. Use a lower frequency filter for the Look Ahead to avoid rapid jerky camera movements when tapping keys.

## 4. Implementation Details
- **File**: `CameraSystem.tsx`
- **Logic**: Use a separate `Damp3` for `lookTarget`.
- **Threshold**: Only apply look ahead if velocity > threshold.

## 5. Code Snippets
```typescript
const targetLook = velocity.clone().multiplyScalar(lookAheadFactor);
damp3(currentLookOffset, targetLook, 0.5, dt); // Slower damp (0.5s)
```

## 6. Expected Benefits
- **Visibility**: Helps seeing where you are going.
- **Comfort**: Reduces motion sickness from rapid direction changes.

## 7. Dependencies
- REQ-011

## 8. Priority Level
**Medium**

## 9. Estimated Complexity
**Moderate**
