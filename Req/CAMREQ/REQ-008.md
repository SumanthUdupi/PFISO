# REQ-008: Minimum Camera Distance & First Person Transition

## 1. Requirement Title
Implement Minimum Camera Distance w/ First Person Transition

## 2. Problem Statement
When the camera gets pushed too close to the player (e.g., in a tight corner), it can clip into the player model or obscure the view.

## 3. Proposed Solution
- Enforce a minimum distance (e.g., 0.5m).
- If collision forces the camera closer than 0.5m, automatically fade out the player model or switch to First Person mode temporarily.

## 4. Implementation Details
- **File**: `CameraSystem.tsx`
- **Logic**: Check `currentDist`. If `< MIN_DIST`, set `playerMesh.visible = false` or switch `CameraMode`.

## 5. Code Snippets
```typescript
if (currentDist < 0.8) {
    playerVisuals.visible = false;
} else {
    playerVisuals.visible = true;
}
```

## 6. Expected Benefits
- **Visibility**: Player never blocks the view in tight spaces.
- **Polish**: Professional camera behavior.

## 7. Dependencies
- `CameraSystem`

## 8. Priority Level
**Medium**

## 9. Estimated Complexity
**Simple**
