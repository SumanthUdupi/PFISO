# REQ-027: Object Inspection Mode

## 1. Requirement Title
Orbit Inspection Mode

## 2. Problem Statement
Players pick up items but can't see details clearly.

## 3. Proposed Solution
A mode where the camera focuses on a held object and the *Player Input* rotates the *Object* instead of the Camera (or orbits the camera around the static object).

## 4. Implementation Details
- **File**: `CameraSystem.tsx`
- **Logic**: Switch to `INSPECT` state. disable movement. Right stick rotates object.

## 5. Code Snippets
```typescript
if (mode === 'INSPECT') {
    // Camera fixed at offset
    // Input rotates objectRef
    objectRef.rotation.y += input.x;
}
```

## 6. Expected Benefits
- **Puzzle Solving**: Allows reading clues on items.

## 7. Dependencies
- REQ-004

## 8. Priority Level
