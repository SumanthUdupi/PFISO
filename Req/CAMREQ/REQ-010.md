# REQ-010: Wall Sliding Camera

## 1. Requirement Title
Wall Sliding Camera Prediction

## 2. Problem Statement
When moving parallel to a wall, the camera often gets "stuck" bouncing against the collision, or lags behind the player because the collision point is strictly behind the player.

## 3. Proposed Solution
Predict where the camera *wants* to be. If the ideal position is inside a wall, slide the target position *along* the wall normal instead of just pulling it closer to the player.

## 4. Implementation Details
- **File**: `CameraSystem.tsx`
- **Logic**:
    - Calculate wall normal on hit.
    - Project the "Ideal Offset" vector onto the wall plane.
    - Use the projected point as the new target.

## 5. Code Snippets
```typescript
const slideVec = idealDir.sub(normal.multiplyScalar(idealDir.dot(normal)));
// Use slideVec to reposition camera target
```

## 6. Expected Benefits
- **Smoothness**: Reduces "hitching" when running alongside walls.
- **Composition**: Maintains better framing.

## 7. Dependencies
- REQ-006

## 8. Priority Level
**Low** (Advanced feature)

## 9. Estimated Complexity
**Complex**
