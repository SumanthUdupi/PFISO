# REQ-013: Velocity-Based Offset (Pull Back)

## 1. Requirement Title
Dynamic Camera Pull-Back on High Speed

## 2. Problem Statement
At high speeds (Sprinting), the camera feels too close, limiting peripheral vision. (Existing implementation has FOV change, but physical distance is often better).

## 3. Proposed Solution
Increase the *distance* of the camera from the player based on speed, in addition to or instead of FOV.

## 4. Implementation Details
- **File**: `CameraSystem.tsx`
- **Logic**: `targetDistance = BaseDist + (Speed / MaxSpeed) * AddedDist`.

## 5. Code Snippets
```typescript
const speedToken = velocity.length() / sprintSpeed;
const dist = 5.0 + speedToken * 2.0; // Pull back up to 2m
```

## 6. Expected Benefits
- **Sense of Speed**: Physically seeing the character get smaller/further enhances speed feeling.
- **Awareness**: Sees more of the environment when moving fast.

## 7. Dependencies
- None

## 8. Priority Level
**Medium**

## 9. Estimated Complexity
**Simple**
