# Art Asset Requirement: ARTREQ_003

## 1. Asset Title
**Large Bay Window with Sill**

## 2. Asset Type
Environment / Structural

## 3. Detailed Description
A large, inviting window that acts as the primary light source for the scene. It features a deep sill (perfect for plants) and a clean white frame. The glass should be semi-transparent or styled to show a skybox, allowing "god rays" to pour in.

## 4. Style Guidelines
- **Aesthetic:** Bright, airy, focal point.
- **Style:** Modern farmhouse or clean contemporary.
- **Feel:** "The connection to the outside world."

## 5. Technical Specifications
- **Dimensions:** 2.5m (width) x 2m (height)
- **File Format:** FBX
- **Polycount:** Medium (~500 tris) including frame and sill.
- **Materials:** Multi-material (Wood/PVC for frame, Glass for panes).
- **Color Palette:**
  - Frame: #ffffff or #fefae0
  - Glass: Tinted Blue-ish #e0f7fa (very subtle)

## 6. Lighting & Color Theme
- **Critical Role:** This is the Emitter for the scene's key light.
- **Bloom:** Glass material needs to interact with bloom settings to create a "hazy morning" feel.
- **Shadows:** Frame must cast crisp shadows on the floor/walls.

## 7. Visual References
- Sims 4 "Bay Window" assets.
- Lo-fi hip hop girl background window.

## 8. Integration Notes
- Fits into a specifically slotted Wall Section (ARTREQ_002 variant).
- Needs a separate collider for the sill to support placing props.

## 9. Portfolio Impact
Demonstrates handling of transparent materials and "frame within a frame" composition techniques.
