# 08 - Narrative Design & Journal System

**Project:** Interactive 3D Portfolio (PFISO)

## 1. Narrative Premise
The player is a "Recruiter" or "Curious Visitor" entering the mental workspace of the Candidate. This isn't just an office—it's a "Mind Palace".

## 2. The Journal System
Replacing the standard HUD Quest Tracker.
- **Visual:** A physical Moleskine-style notebook that opens on screen (Press `TAB`).
- **Pages:**
    1.  **Map:** Hand-drawn floor plan of the office. "You are here" marker.
    2.  **To-Do List:** The objectives (e.g., "Review Engineering Skills").
        - *Animation:* Items get crossed out with a satisfying scribble animation when completed.
    3.  **Collection:** Slots for the "Stickers" found in the world.
    4.  **Notes:** Auto-populated interesting facts found in the world.

## 3. Environmental Storytelling
The space tells the story of the candidate's work ethic and personality.
- **The "Chaos" vs. "Order":**
    - The *Code* desk is organized (Professional).
    - The *Idea* whiteboard is chaotic (Creative).
- **Post-It Notes:** 
    - "Deploy to Prod" (Urgent).
    - "Call Mom" (Human).
    - "Buy more coffee" (Relatable).
- **Email Snippets:** On the computer screen, visible "Thank You" emails from past clients/bosses (Social Proof).

## 4. Audio Logs (Commentary)
**Concept:** "Director's Commentary".
- **Trigger:** Finding a specific artifact (e.g., the Award Trophy).
- **Effect:** A voiceover plays: *"I remember this project. We had a deadline of 48 hours and the server crashed..."*
- **Value:** Adds personality and voice to the static achievements.

## 5. The Ending
**Trigger:** Completing all core objectives.
- **Event:** The "Contact" phone rings.
- **Interaction:** Picking it up.
- **Result:** "Thanks for visiting. Let's build something together." -> Displays final Call to Action (Email/LinkedIn).
- **Free Roam:** Game does not end; player can stay and "chill" in the space indefinitely (Endgame State).
